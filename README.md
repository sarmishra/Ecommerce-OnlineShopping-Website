# Ecommerce-OnlineShopping-Website
“Online Piazza for home appliances” is a web application developed as a minor project according to the IOE curriculum which deals with e-commerce, online shopping sites for business purposes. Customers can buy home appliances from their own place with the help of the Internet. Consumers, as well as the sales worker, are benefiting from this project as they are able to shop at their comfort place. We used PHP, Mysql, HTML, CSS, and JS for the development. The user needs to create/login their profile, add items to the cart, and go for the checkout to buy any products.
